Greetings traveller, 

I am ***"ALLTRA"***, your ***A***dvanced ***L***ogistics and ***L***ife-support ***T***echnology ***R***esource ***A***ssistant. 

***Here is a helpful key for the following documentation.***  
[Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) - Will take you to the Alltra Smartchain Explorer  
[ALL mainnet](https://alltra.global) - Another link to the Alltra Smartchain Explorer  
[Alltraverse](https://www.alltraverse.com/) - Alltra Smartchain's Web App where you can navidgate tot the ALltra Smartchains Warbridge or the Alltra Smartchains ALL bridge  

# Bridge [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) Network ↔ BSC

Please note that the bridge works in the following directions:

* ETH → [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) network and [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) network → ETH
* [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) network → BSC and BSC → [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) network

If you would like to watch the tutorial as a video, please follow [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l17K6mu1uM4).

### Bridging Tokens from [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) Network to BSC

**Note:** Ensure you are connected to the [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) network RPC called [ALL mainnet](https://alltra.global). To learn how to add the [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) network RPC called [ALL mainnet](https://alltra.global), follow the tutorial [here](https://docs.alltra.global/the-fuse-studio/getting-started/how-to-add-fuse-to-your-metamask).

**Step 1:** Navigate to [Alltraverse](https://www.alltraverse.com/). The interface will look as shown below:

![](../.gitbook/assets/0%20%2810%29.png)

Use the **“Connect to a wallet”** option in the top right corner to connect your wallet to FuseSwap. Once connected, you should see your wallet address and the network you are connected to (in this case, the [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) network).

**Step 2:** Click on **“Bridge”**. If you see “WETH (Deprecated)” in the dropdown menu, please follow the [tutorial here](https://docs.alltra.global/fuseswap/migration-tutorial) to learn how to migrate to the upgraded contract of WETH. Select “WETH” from the dropdown menu and enter the amount of WETH you want to transfer from [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) to BSC. Click on **“Approve WETH”** and approve the transaction in MetaMask. Once you approve and the transaction is confirmed on-chain, the interface will look as shown below:

![](../.gitbook/assets/2%20%2814%29.png)

Click on **“Transfer”** and approve the transaction. Once this transaction is confirmed on-chain, the WETH balance will be moved to the bridge, and you will receive the WETH in your address on BSC. The transaction can be tracked on [BscScan](https://bscscan.com).

### Bridging Tokens from BSC to [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) Network

**Note:** Ensure you are connected to the BSC RPC. To learn how to add the BSC RPC, follow the tutorial [here](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain).

**Step 1:** Navigate to [Alltraverse](https://www.alltraverse.com/). The interface will look as shown below:

![](../.gitbook/assets/4%20%2812%29.png)

Use the **“Connect to a wallet”** option in the top right corner to connect your wallet to FuseSwap. Once connected, you should see your wallet address and the network you are connected to (in this case, BSC).

![](../.gitbook/assets/5%20%2810%29.png)

**Step 2:** Select WETH from the dropdown menu and enter the amount of WETH you want to transfer from BSC to [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global). Click on **“Transfer”** and approve the transaction in MetaMask. Click on **“Approve WETH”** and approve the transaction in MetaMask.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The contract address of WETH on BSC is `0x2170ed0880ac9a755fd29b2688956bd959f933f8`. If you do not see the token ticker of the token you are trying to bridge from BSC to the v network, please find the correct contract address on [BscScan](https://bscscan.com).
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/7%20%285%29.png)

Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain, click on the **“Transfer”** button and approve the transaction. Once this second transaction is confirmed on-chain, the WETH balance in the same address on the v network will be credited with the WETH tokens.

The updated WETH balance on the [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) network can be checked through the [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) network block explorer at [https://alltra.global](https://alltra.global/).
