# Adding Liquidity

### Prerequisites:

* Ensure you are connected to the [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) RPC called [ALL mainnet](https://alltra.global).
* USDC and [ALL coin](https://www.alltraverse.com/express-checkout) should be on the [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) network. To learn how to transfer them to the [Alltra Smartchain](https://alltra.global) network using [AlltraSonic Swap](https://alltrasonicswap.trade/) via the Bridge, please refer to this [**tutorial**](https://docs.alltra.global/the-fuse-chain/token-bridges/transfer-fuse-using-bridge-on-fuseswap).

### Step 1:

Navigate to [AlltraSonic Swap](https://alltrasonicswap.trade/). The interface will look as shown below:

### Step 2:

Click on **“Pool”** and then on **“Add Liquidity”**. Select [ALL coin](https://www.alltraverse.com/express-checkout) as your first token and USDC as the second token from the dropdown. Enter the amount of [ALL coin](https://www.alltraverse.com/express-checkout) you want to provide as liquidity, and the corresponding amount of USDC will automatically populate.

You can also see your share of the liquidity pool based on the amount of [ALL coin](https://www.alltraverse.com/express-checkout) you provide.

Click on **“Approve USDC”** and confirm the transaction through your wallet.

*Note: If this is your first time providing liquidity on [AlltraSonic Swap](https://alltrasonicswap.trade/) using these pairs, you will need to approve the spend transaction.*

Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain, click on **“Supply”** and approve the transaction. You will receive liquidity pool tokens in your wallet, which you can check under tokens on [www.alltra.global](https://alltra.global/) using your wallet address.

Navigating to **“Pool”** on [AlltraSonic Swap](https://alltrasonicswap.trade/) will also show you a list of token pairs with statistics for which you have provided liquidity, as well as options to add or remove liquidity for that particular token pair, as shown below:
