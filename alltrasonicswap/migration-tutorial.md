### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Navigate to [AlltraSonic Swap](https://alltrasonicswap.trade/)
.  

Use the **“Connect to a wallet”** button in the top right corner to connect your wallet to [AlltraSonic Swap](https://alltrasonicswap.trade/)
. Once connected, you should see your wallet address and the network you're connected to (in this case, the [ALL mainnet](https://alltra.global)).


### Step 2: Bridge Your Tokens

Click on **“Swap”**. When you click on **“Select a token”**. Click on **“Approve”** and approve the transaction in MetaMask.

Once you approve, [AlltraSonic Swap](https://alltrasonicswap.trade/)
 will automatically prompt you to migrate to the new contract.  


### Step 3: Migrate WALL

Click on **“Approve WALL”** and approve the transaction in your wallet. Once the transaction is confirmed, click on **“Migrate”**.


Once the second transaction is confirmed, the WALL will be migrated to the updated contract address. You can verify this by checking the dropdown menu again, where the updated WALL balance will be reflected.
