Once the transaction is confirmed on chain, the **“Transfer”** can be clicked and transaction has to be approved. Once this second transaction is confirmed onchain the ALL balance in the same address on Alltra network will have the updated balance of ALL which can be checked through [www.alltra.global](http://www.alltra.global/).
