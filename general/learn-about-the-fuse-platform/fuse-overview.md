# Alltra Overview: vision, strategy and platform components

Alltra is a decentralized blockchain-powered platform and technology stack whose goal is to enable genuine mass adoption of crypto payments and decentralized finance (DeFi). Enabling the Hyper-Barter Exchange and 11:11 Coin MEE (Micro Economic ecosystem)&#x20;

The project was launched in 2019 by a team with a long-term vision for a widely adopted digital payments platform and Wealth creation project aimed at bringing The Hyper-Barter Exchange to the blockchain.

### The Problem

The currently existing financial system falls way short of the objective of providing the people globally with access to fast, frictionless payments, attractive financial services and passive income opportunities.

Stagnation of surplus stock, unused surplus capacity in the retail sector lead to lost value and incomes for the commercial enterprise, while denying sectors of the population access to said surplus capacity. As long as Value / Liquidity is born from debt this situation will undoubtedly continue.

This is especially relevant for the developing countries. Hundreds of millions of people there lack access even to the basic banking services, let alone access to more advanced financial opportunities. They also often have to transact using highly unstable fiat currencies, prone to episodes of sudden profound devaluation.

At the same time, even in the poorest countries, the pace of mobile phone adoption has been staggering. In sub-Saharan Africa, more people have access to mobile phones than to clean drinking water.

In addition to this, the rise of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has finally created the possibility for potentially anyone on the planet to send and receive funds without the permission of any entity, using currencies that cannot be manipulated.

### What the crypto industry still lacks

However, while we are observing a lot of activity in the crypto space (especially in the crypto asset markets, and the DeFi and NFT sectors), genuine mass adoption of crypto payments and DeFi is still not there.

The currently available products and tools, with their complicated and disparate UX, are mostly geared towards sophisticated crypto users with significant financial means.

Add to that the concerns in the mass market in regard to where the value of a cryptocurrency is derived and how it is maintained.&#x20;

### How we go about it

Our approach to bringing crypto payments and DeFi to the masses primarily consists in empowering other projects, businesses, organizations and communities to adopt crypto payments and decentralized finance (DeFi).

We support this with 1 Pre-established Gold backed Currency called [11:11 coin](https://alltra.world). As well as its running mate HYBX (11:11 coins Promissory Token)&#x20;

This is achieved by providing clients with **convenient, mobile-first tools for creating and managing token-powered environments**, as well as for onboarding users to those and enabling them to interact.

### Platform Components

The Alltra platform has three main components:

1\) **The Alltra blockchain**. The EVM-compatible public blockchain is the decentralized, permissionless backbone of the Alltra platform and ecosystem.

2\) **The mobile-centric open-source technology stack** designed to help businesses and developers plug crypto payments into real-world use cases. This toolkit has subsumed into the new [Alltra Charge](https://chargeweb3.com/) API platform.

3\) **A set of reference decentralized finance (DeFi) products and tools**. The goal of these is to pave the way for the initial adoption of the platform. \\

4\) **Genuine Gold backed Stable coin** Supports the Value of the Platform Plus the addition of our retail Market place and Merchant membership group. Providing Prof of Productivity (POP)&#x20;
