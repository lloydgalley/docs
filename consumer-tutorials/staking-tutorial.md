**Note:** You can only stake ALL Coin which is on Alltra Smartchain network. Please make sure you have changed into Alltra Smartchain network (ALL MAINNET) in Metamask while doing any transactions on staking UI.


***YOU MUST BE APPROVED TO STAKE BY ALLTRA HEAD OFFICE! THIS INCLUDES HAVING PAID THE MINIMUM REQUIRED FEE OR PURCHASED A DELEGATION POSITION.*** 

To find out how to be approved and/ or purchase a delegation position, contact ALLTA Head office [via email](mailto:team@alltra.world).

***NOTE: ALL DELEGATION POSITIONS ARE PROCESSED BY ALLTRA HEAD OFFICE AND PRE STAKED FOR YOUR CONVIENANCE.*** 
ANY ATTEMPTS TO PERFORM THIS WITHOUT THE CONSENT AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM ALLTRA HEAD OFFICE WILL RESULTY IN YOUR DELEGATION POSITION BEING REMOVED FROM THE VALIDATOR. Read T's and C's for more information reagading delegation and the rights to do so on the ALLTRA SMartchain.

How to Stake ALL Coin on the ALLTRA Smartchain:

**Step 3:**

Select the Validator node where you want to delegate your tokens by considering various factors like fees, uptime etc.

You should see the **“stake**” option when you hover over the Validator you want to delegate your tokens to and click on stake. You should see the name of the validator you selected on the right hand side. Enter the amount you want to stake and click on **“Stake”.** Approve the transaction on Metamask and wait for the confirmation on-chain.

You will also see the APY on staking when you enter the amount of ALL you want to stake. You can see the staked amount right next to the validator name to whom you have delegated you stake to.

**How to Unstake ALL:**

Click on the Validator name and you should see the validator name with address on the right hand side. Click on **“unstake”** and enter the amount you want to unstake and click on **“unstake”**. Confirm the transaction on Metamask and wait for the on-chain confirmation. Once the transaction is confirmed the unstaked amount is transferred back to your address.
